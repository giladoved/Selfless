# Selfless
HackDFW 2015!

What inspired us was that there are millions of people out there using social media, but all of those likes and comments are only worth it to the companies who provide the service. With Selfless, you will be able to post images/tweets in different social media outlets on which your friends can #donateSelfless and give a cent to the charity of your liking. Although one cent sounds like nothing, with millions of users and exponentially more likes/comments, one cent per person will be able to help those in need.
